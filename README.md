# copsupp

These are the files of an R package that's intended to be a supplement to the CopulaModel package. Check out the vignette to see how to use it.

The package isn't quite intended for users yet, and the vignette reflects that. Take a look at the issues.md to see ideas for what's next, and what needs fixing.
