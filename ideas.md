1. It may be useful to consider making a class of type "copula". I'd have to be clever in what it looks like.
	* Allows to check whether a copula exists.
	* Allows for the inclusion of parameter spaces
	* Allows users to make their own copulas
	* Reduces a slew of functions (pcop, rcop, qcondcop, pcondcop12, etc) to one object.
	* Allows for copula rotations.
